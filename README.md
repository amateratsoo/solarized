## âœ¨ Struggles <a id='struggles'></a>

No struggles at all.

## âœ¨ Lessons <a id='lessons'></a>

I now understand why experienced devs use third party tools to implement differents modes, this was a small project but the theme part took a good amount of time to get ready, because of that I think that in big projects is better to focus on the logic, data treatment and important features rather than the themes, especially when third party tools handle that for us.
