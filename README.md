## ✨ Project <a id='project'></a>

Part of my one week projects, this project helped me train my CSS, UI, JS and logic skills. My main goal with this was to develop an elegant, interative and pleaseant login form and is the first time that I implement a dark/ligth mode system.

You can see my insights and breakdowns throught the project in [this](TODO.md) link.

## ✨ Tools <a id='tools'></a>

Tools and tecnologies that I used in this project:

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`
- `LocalStorage`

## ✨ Struggles <a id='struggles'></a>

No struggles at all.

## ✨ Lessons <a id='lessons'></a>

I now understand why experienced devs use third party tools to implement differents modes, this was a small project but the theme part took a good amount of time to get ready, because of that I think that in big projects is better to focus on the logic, data treatment and important features rather than the themes, especially when third party tools handle that for us.
